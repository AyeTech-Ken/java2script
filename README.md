# About java2script/SwingJS


These notes are for Java developers who want to convert their Java applets or Java applications to 
JavaScript, allowing continued one-source development of both Java and JavaScript. SwingJS is not
a one-time "port" to JavaScript. It is a system that allows real-time Java-to-JavaScript conversion
within Eclipse, with immediate JavaScript testing and debugging in a browser based on code development
in Java. Using the java2script/SwingJS Eclipse plug-in, both Java .class files and their equivalent .js files are created simultaneously. 

Developers of java2script/SwingJS itself should read README-developers.md

java2script/SwingJS includes an Eclipse plug-in (technically a "drop-in"), net.sf.j2s.core.zip, 
along with a JavaScript version of the Java Virtual Machine (SwingJS) to allow the rapid and
automated production of browser-ready JavaScript versions of Java applications and applets.
