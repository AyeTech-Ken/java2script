The net.sf.j2s.java.core Eclipse j2s project creates the run-time JavaScript "JVM" for SwingJS. 

You should only be working here if you are making new JavaScript files from Java 
or adapting/fixing the runtime JavaScript files.

Do not run any of the Java or compiled JavaScript here. This project just creates the 
files needed by other projects.
